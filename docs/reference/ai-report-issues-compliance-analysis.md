## Compliance Updates Made

### Title Formatting
- ✅ Removed colons from all issue titles (per workflow guideline: "Both issue titles and PR titles should NOT use colons")
- Changed format from "Security: ..." to "Security - ..."

### Labels
- ✅ Added missing `Fix` label to issues #450 and #449
- ✅ All issues now have proper component labels
- ✅ All issues have priority labels (P1 or P2)
- ✅ All issues have security label

### Assignees
- ✅ All issues have assignees (sbadakhc)

### Issue Types
- ⚠️ **Manual Action Required:** All three issues need their GitHub issue type set to **Bug** in the GitHub web interface
  - GitHub CLI does not support setting issue types directly
  - Issue types (Bug/Feature/Task) are separate from labels
  - These are security bugs and should be marked as "Bug" type

## Workflow Compliance Checklist

| Issue | Title Format | Component Label | Priority Label | Category Label | Assignee | Issue Type |
|-------|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| #451 | ✅ Fixed | ✅ component:cli | ✅ P2 | ✅ Fix | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Needs Bug |
| #450 | ✅ Fixed | ✅ component:infrastructure | ✅ P1 | ✅ Fix | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Needs Bug |
| #449 | ✅ Fixed | ✅ component:infrastructure | ✅ P1 | ✅ Fix | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Needs Bug |

## Discrepancies Found

### Label Naming Inconsistency

**Issue:** Documentation vs. Reality mismatch

- **Workflow Documentation Says:** Priority labels should be `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
- **Actual GitHub Labels:** `P1`, `P2`, `P3`

**Impact:** 
- Documentation is inconsistent with actual repository labels
- Examples in workflow docs reference `priority:high` but actual labels are `P1`
- This may cause confusion for contributors

**Recommendation:** 
- Either update workflow documentation to reflect actual labels (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`)
- Or create new labels (`priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`) and migrate existing issues
- Document the decision in workflow guide

### Component Label Inconsistency

**Issue:** `component:llm-council` vs `component:council`

- **Workflow Documentation Says:** Should be `component:council`
- **Actual GitHub Label:** `component:llm-council` exists
- **Note:** Issue #433 was about renaming llm-council to council, but the label may not have been updated

**Recommendation:**
- Verify if `component:llm-council` label should be renamed to `component:council`
- Update workflow documentation or migrate label accordingly

## Actionability Assessment

### All Issues Should Be Actioned

**Reasoning:**
1. **All are security-related** - Security issues should be prioritized
2. **Two are high priority (P1)** - Issues #450 and #449 are marked as high priority
3. **Clear scope** - All issues have well-defined problems and suggested solutions
4. **Assigned** - All issues have assignees, indicating intent to work on them

### Recommended Priority Order

1. **Issue #450** (P1) - Harden Docker Socket Mounts
   - Highest risk: Docker socket access is a critical security concern
   - Affects multiple services (watchtower, promtail)

2. **Issue #449** (P1) - Reduce Docker Network Exposure
   - High risk: Network isolation bypass
   - Affects overall infrastructure security

3. **Issue #451** (P2) - Sanitize Database Inputs
   - Medium priority but still security-related
   - SQL injection prevention is important

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Completed:** Updated issue titles to remove colons
2. ✅ **Completed:** Added missing `Fix` labels
3. ⚠️ **Manual Action Required:** Set issue types to "Bug" in GitHub UI for all three issues
4. 📋 **Recommendation:** Address security issues in priority order (#450, #449, #451)
5. 📋 **Recommendation:** Resolve label naming inconsistency (P1/P2/P3 vs priority:high/medium/low)
6. 📋 **Recommendation:** Verify and update `component:llm-council` label if needed

## Summary

All three open issues are security-related and should be actioned. They have been updated to comply with the developer workflow guidelines:
- ✅ Titles fixed (no colons)
- ✅ Proper labels applied
- ✅ Assignees present
- ⚠️ Issue types need manual setting in GitHub UI

The issues are well-documented, have clear scope, and are ready for implementation work to begin.
