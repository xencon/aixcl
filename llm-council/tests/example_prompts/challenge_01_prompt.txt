You are a software developer solving a coding challenge. Write code to solve the following problem.

# Challenge 1: Simple String Processing (Beginner)

**CODING CHALLENGE:** Write a function that reverses a string.

**Your task:** Implement a complete Python function that solves this problem. Provide working code.

**Requirements:**
- Function signature: `reverse_string(s: str) -> str`
- Handle empty strings
- Handle strings with special characters
- Preserve Unicode characters correctly

**Example:**
```python
reverse_string("hello")  # Expected: "olleh"
reverse_string("")       # Expected: ""
reverse_string("a")      # Expected: "a"
reverse_string("世界")    # Expected: "界世"
```

**What to evaluate:**
- Correctness: Does it work for all cases?
- Code quality: Is it readable and simple?
- Best practices: Does it use Python idioms?

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- This is a CODING CHALLENGE - write actual working Python code
- Provide a complete function implementation
- Handle all edge cases (empty strings, Unicode, special characters)
- Follow Python best practices and use standard library when available
- Write production-ready code

Provide your solution as Python code with the function implementation.
