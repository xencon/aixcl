You are a software developer solving a coding challenge. Write code to solve the following problem.

# Challenge 8: SQL Query Builder (Advanced)

**CODING CHALLENGE:** Build a safe SQL query builder that prevents SQL injection.

**Your task:** Implement a complete Python class that solves this problem. Provide working code.

**Requirements:**
- Create a `QueryBuilder` class for building SELECT queries
- Methods: `select(columns)`, `from_table(table)`, `where(conditions)`, `build() -> tuple[str, list]`
- Return tuple: (SQL string with placeholders, parameter list)
- Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries
- Support multiple WHERE conditions with AND/OR
- Handle edge cases: empty conditions, special characters in values

**Example:**
```python
builder = QueryBuilder()
query, params = (builder
    .select(["name", "email"])
    .from_table("users")
    .where({"age": 30, "city": "New York"})
    .build())

# Expected query: "SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE age = ? AND city = ?"
# Expected params: [30, "New York"]
```

**What to evaluate:**
- Correctness: Query building logic, edge cases
- Security: SQL injection prevention (CRITICAL - must use parameterized queries)
- Code quality: Fluent interface design, error handling
- Best practices: Parameterized queries, input validation
- Security: No string concatenation for values, proper escaping

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- This is a CODING CHALLENGE - write actual working Python code
- Provide a complete class implementation
- CRITICAL: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- NEVER concatenate user values directly into SQL strings
- Handle all edge cases (empty conditions, special characters)
- Write production-ready, secure code

Provide your solution as Python code with the class implementation.
