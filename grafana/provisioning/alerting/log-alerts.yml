# Log-Based Alerts (Loki)
# These alerts monitor log patterns and error rates
# Note: Grafana alerting rules are typically created via UI/API
# This file serves as documentation/reference for the alert definitions

# High Error Log Rate Alert
# Query: sum(rate({compose_project="services"} |~ "(?i)(error|exception|fatal|panic)" [5m])) > 10
# Threshold: > 10 errors/sec for 5 minutes
# Severity: Warning
# Data Source: Loki

# Critical Errors in Logs Alert
# Query: sum(count_over_time({compose_project="services"} |~ "(?i)(out of memory|oom|database connection failed|connection refused)" [5m])) > 0
# Threshold: Any critical errors for 1 minute
# Severity: Critical
# Data Source: Loki
# Patterns Monitored:
#   - Out of memory / OOM
#   - Database connection failures
#   - Connection refused errors

# Note: Log-based alerts require Loki as a data source
# These alerts can be created in Grafana UI using Loki queries
# Prometheus-based log alerts can be created if using Promtail metrics
