# GPU Metrics Alerts
# These alerts monitor GPU temperature, memory usage, and availability
# Note: Grafana alerting rules are typically created via UI/API
# This file serves as documentation/reference for the alert definitions

# High GPU Temperature Alert
# Query: DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_TEMP > 85
# Threshold: > 85°C for 5 minutes
# Severity: Warning

# High GPU Memory Usage Alert
# Query: (DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED / (DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED + DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_FREE)) * 100 > 90
# Threshold: > 90% memory usage for 5 minutes
# Severity: Warning

# GPU Unavailable Alert
# Query: up{job="nvidia-gpu"} == 0
# Threshold: Unavailable for 2 minutes
# Severity: Warning
# Note: This may fire on systems without GPUs - can be ignored in that case

# These alerts are implemented in prometheus/alerts.yml under the aixcl_gpu group
