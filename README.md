## AIXCL Platform Overview

### Overview

AIXCL is an AI-powered software engineering platform designed to accelerate and streamline the software development process. Key features include:

- Automated test generation and code suggestions.
- AI-powered pull request and code review assistance.
- Seamless integration with the IDE and CI/CD pipeline.


### Technology Stack

- Open-source software and readily available Large Language Models (LLMs) form the foundation of the platform.
- Users can extend the platform with proprietary tooling as needed.


### Platform Specifications

**POC Platform:**

- Designed for teams of 3-5 developers.
- Uses 5-10 LLM models (7GB each).
- Runs on an AWS instance with a single GPU.


**AWS Instance:**

- Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
- Instance Type: g4dn.xlarge
- 4x CPU
- 1x GPU
- 16GB RAM
- Note: You should have at least 8 GB of RAM available to run the 7B models, 16 GB to run the 13B models, and 32 GB to run the 33B models.

**prerequisites:**

- Ubuntu Linux
- Docker
- Nvidia divers and toolset

**Server Ports:**

- 11434 Ollama
- 3000 Open WebUI
- 22 SSH Access

### Installation Instructions

Install Ollama and Open WebUI via docker.
```
docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama --restart always
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

Check the containers are running.
```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND               CREATED       STATUS                 PORTS                                           NAMES

```

Check the endpoints are available with curl and look for status code 200 OK.
```
head -n1 <(curl -I http://www.example.com:11434 2> /dev/null)
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

head -n1 <(curl -I http://www.example.com:3000 2> /dev/null)
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Install the LLM.
```
docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama3
>>> Send a message (/? for help
```

Exit the LLM prompt with CTRL-D

You can list the installed LLM with
```
docker exec -it ollama ollama list
NAME                    ID              SIZE    MODIFIED   
llama3:latest           365c0bd3c000    4.7 GB  7 days ago
```

At this stage the server is installed with Ollama, Open WebUI and The Meta LLama3 LLM.

You should now browse to your server instance via Open WebUI and use the signup button to create your admin account.
```
http://www.example.com:3000 
```
