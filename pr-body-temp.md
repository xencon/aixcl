Addresses #356

## Changes
- [x] Added workflow guidance for handling automated PRs
- [x] Documented process for retroactive documentation of automated fixes
- [x] Updated AI Assistant Instructions to include automated PR handling

## Summary

This PR adds documentation to the development workflow about how to handle automated PRs from GitHub Code Quality (Copilot Autofix). These PRs may bypass the standard Issue-First workflow, but should still be documented for traceability.

The guidance ensures that:
- Automated PRs are still reviewed carefully
- Work is documented retroactively when automation creates PRs directly
- Traceability is maintained even when workflow is bypassed

## Testing
- Verified markdown formatting is correct
- Confirmed workflow documentation structure is maintained
