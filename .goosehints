# AIXCL Project Hints for Goose

## Project Overview

AIXCL is a self-hosted AI development platform with a fixed runtime core (Ollama, LLM-Council, Continue).
See docs/architecture/governance/ for architectural invariants.

## Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

Follow the Issue-First Development workflow:

1. **Always create an issue first** before starting any work:
   ```
   gh issue create --title "Brief description" --body "Description" --label "component:cli" --assignee sbadakhc
   ```

2. **Create a branch** from main:
   ```
   git checkout -b issue-<number>/<short-description>
   ```

3. **Commit** with conventional format:
   ```
   git commit -m "type: Description

   Fixes #<number>"
   ```

4. **Push and create PR** that references the issue:
   ```
   gh pr create --title "Fix Title (#<number>)" --body "Fixes #<number>"
   gh pr edit <number> --add-assignee sbadakhc --add-label "component:..."
   ```

## Architectural Rules

- Do NOT modify runtime core components (Ollama, LLM-Council, Continue)
- Do NOT introduce dependencies from runtime core to operational services
- Prefer declarative configuration over imperative logic
- Keep changes small and reversible

## Formatting

- Use markdown checkboxes: `- [x]` not Unicode checkmarks
- PR titles should NOT include colons
- Keep commit first line under 72 characters
